- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VictoriaKinkajou
- ðŸŒ± I recently graduated from the Data Analytics course at AiCore and I'm now looking at employment opportunities. I have a particular interest in environment, agriculture and life sciences, but I'm happy to consider any industry as I simply love finding answers in big data.
- âœ¨ I have commercial experience in various industries including lighting and video software, aviation and pharma.
